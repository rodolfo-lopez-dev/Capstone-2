## Data Cleanup and Transaction Anaysis
This projects focus was on doing two different tasks which include cleaning up a list of data and analyzing transaction data using Python and using Jupyter Notebook

### Part 1: Data Cleanup
This section I demonstrated how to
1. Format names
2. Adjust errors in phone numbers by giving a strict format (e.g., +1-XXX-XXX-XXXX)
3. Determine how to use SMS as a valuable assist to the company

### Part 2: Transaction Analysis 
This section I demonstrated how to 
1. Preview and extract important information from a broad dataset
2. Apply data transformations to better visualize insights, also added new columns such as (e.g., Month, Year, Weekday)
3. Highlight top performing products and customers to optimize revenue
